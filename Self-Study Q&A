1. Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.

    (1) Express organize code by creating route handlers for requests.
    (2) Utilize middleware to manage code.

2. Describe Middleware?

    Middleware are functions that manipulate data and its action.

3. Describe a Resource?

Resource can be any information like a document, image, service with a type, data, and a set of methods operated on it. The methods can be the GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE request. RESTful API is a resource.

4. What can the API return to help clients know if a request was successful?

    API returns status code and maybe the data the client requests for.

5. How can we partition our application into sub-applications?

    By using routers, we can specify which data in our application goes to which sub-application.
